## End of Service
As of April 24, 2023 this project has reached end of service (EOS). It has been a fun and challenging road but even moreso a great learning opportunity. Alas,
all great things come to an end. I thank each and every contributor for their feedback, suggestions and PRs.

The greates of shout-outs deserves [Azurethi(#0789)](https://github.com/azurethi) for his amazing work on Yazur, an open-source YOLOL interpreter written in JS. It was his work alone that made V2 of this project come to fruition.

Starting Jan 15, 2024 the initial URL for this project will loose its validity - however will continue to be reachable via [this new link](https://yolol.pasu.me/).
